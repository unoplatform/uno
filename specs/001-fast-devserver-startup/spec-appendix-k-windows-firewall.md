# Appendix K: Windows Firewall — Private Network Support

> **Parent**: [Main Spec](spec.md)
> **Related**: [Manual QA](spec-appendix-h-manual-qa.md)

Physical Android/iOS devices and other remote clients (WSL, VMs) cannot connect to
the DevServer when the development machine is on a **Private** Wi-Fi network on
Windows, while the emulator (AVD) and loopback clients are unaffected.
This appendix explains the root cause, the fix, and how to verify it.

---

## 1. Root Cause

### 1.1 Windows Firewall profile model

Windows Firewall classifies every network interface as one of three profiles:
**Domain**, **Private**, or **Public**.  Wi-Fi and Ethernet home/office networks
are normally classified as **Private**.  Inbound Allow rules can be scoped to one
or more profiles.

### 1.2 How the regression was introduced

| Era | How the host was launched | Firewall rule created |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Before 6.7 | `Uno.UI.RemoteControl.Host.exe` directly | Windows dialog → user clicked *Allow* → Private + Public rule for that exe |
| 6.7+ (current) | `dotnet.exe Uno.UI.RemoteControl.Host.dll` | Reuses the existing `dotnet.exe` SDK rule — **Public only** (Private and Domain not covered) |

The .NET SDK installer creates an inbound Allow rule for `dotnet.exe` that covers
the **Public** profile only.  When the DevServer host process is launched as
`dotnet.exe <host.dll>` with `CreateNoWindow = true`, the Windows Firewall
interactive dialog never appears — so no new Private rule is ever created.

Result: physical Android/iOS devices on a Private Wi-Fi network are silently blocked
by the firewall before any TCP connection reaches the DevServer.

### 1.3 Why the emulator is unaffected

Android emulators (AVD) connect to the host via `10.0.2.2`, which routes through
the ADB USB/TCP bridge.  This path bypasses the Windows network stack entirely —
the firewall does not apply.  Loopback clients (Desktop, WASM) are similarly
unaffected because loopback traffic is never subject to inbound firewall rules.

### 1.4 Why the Domain profile matters too

Developers working on corporate networks are classified under the **Domain** profile
(Active Directory membership).  This is a common setup: the machine is domain-joined
but the developer has local admin rights and tests with physical devices on the same
LAN.  The SDK installer rule covers only Public, so Domain is equally blocked.

Any client that reaches the DevServer over a real network interface (physical Android/iOS
device, WSL, VM, browser on a second machine) is subject to the same gap — regardless
of whether the profile is Private or Domain.  The fix therefore covers both.

---

## 2. Fix

### 2.1 Principle

The DevServer CLI (`uno-devserver start`) is the single launch point for all IDEs
(VS, VS Code, Rider) and for MCP/agent-initiated starts.  It is therefore the
correct and only location for the fix.

Before spawning the DevServer host, `StartCommandHandler.RunAsync()` calls
`WindowsFirewallHelper.EnsurePrivateRuleAsync()`.  This helper:

1. Resolves the path of the running `dotnet.exe`.
2. Checks whether a Private-profile inbound Allow rule already exists for that path.
3. If not, launches an elevated `netsh` process (UAC prompt) to add one.
4. Logs the outcome clearly; gracefully degrades if UAC is declined.

The operation is **idempotent** — the UAC prompt appears at most once per machine.

### 2.2 The firewall rule

```
Name:      Uno DevServer (.NET Host)
Direction: Inbound
Action:    Allow
Program:   <dotnet.exe path>
Profile:   Private, Domain
```

The rule covers **Private** (home/office Wi-Fi) and **Domain** (corporate
Active Directory networks where the developer has local admin rights).
**Public** is intentionally omitted — the .NET SDK installer already creates a
Public rule for `dotnet.exe`, so it is already covered.

The rule targets `dotnet.exe` (a stable SDK path), not a specific DevServer DLL or
NuGet package version.  It remains valid across SDK and package upgrades.

### 2.3 Files changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/Uno.UI.DevServer.Cli/StartCommandHandler.cs` | Call `WindowsFirewallHelper.EnsurePrivateRuleAsync()` before host spawn on Windows |
| `src/Uno.UI.DevServer.Cli/Helpers/WindowsFirewallHelper.cs` | New file — Windows-only helper (`[SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]`) |

### 2.4 `WindowsFirewallHelper` algorithm

```
1. Resolve dotnet.exe path
   a. Environment.ProcessPath   (CLI itself runs under dotnet.exe — most reliable)
   b. %DOTNET_ROOT%\dotnet.exe  (fallback)
   c. Scan PATH                 (last resort)
   If no path resolved → log debug, return (skip check).

2. Check for existing Private rule
   Run: netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all dir=in verbose
   Parse output into rule blocks (blank-line-separated).
   A rule satisfies the check if:
     - its Program line contains dotnet.exe path (case-insensitive)
     - its Profiles line contains "Private" or "Any"
     - its Action is "Allow"
   If satisfied → return (no UAC, no log noise).

3. Add the rule (rule absent)
   Log: "Adding Windows Firewall rule — a UAC prompt will appear."
   Run elevated: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule
                   name="Uno DevServer (.NET Host)"
                   dir=in action=allow
                   program="<dotnet.exe path>"
                   enable=yes profile=private,domain
     via Process.Start { Verb="runas", UseShellExecute=true }
   Exit 0  → log success.
   Non-0 or exception → log warning + manual PowerShell command, return.

4. Graceful degradation (UAC declined or netsh failed)
   DevServer continues to start.
   Warning logged with manual workaround:
     New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Uno DevServer (.NET Host)" `
       -Direction Inbound -Action Allow `
       -Program (Get-Command dotnet).Source `
       -Profile @("Private", "Domain")
```

### 2.5 Startup impact

- **Happy path (rule exists):** one `netsh show` call, output parsing — < 100 ms.
- **First run (rule absent):** UAC prompt + one `netsh add` call — one-time per machine.
- **No solution or non-Windows:** the entire block is skipped.

## 3. Requirements

### Functional

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| FR-FW1 | On Windows, `StartCommandHandler` must ensure a Private-profile inbound Allow rule exists for `dotnet.exe` before spawning the host. |
| FR-FW2 | The check must be idempotent — if the rule already exists no elevation is requested. |
| FR-FW3 | If the rule is absent, the CLI must prompt for UAC elevation via an elevated `netsh` invocation. |
| FR-FW4 | If UAC is declined or `netsh` fails, the CLI must log a warning with the manual PowerShell command and continue startup normally (no crash, no exception propagation). |
| FR-FW5 | The rule must target the exact `dotnet.exe` path the CLI is running under. |
| FR-FW6 | The rule display name must be `"Uno DevServer (.NET Host)"` so it is recognizable in the Windows Firewall UI. |

### Non-functional

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| NFR-FW1 | Happy-path overhead (rule exists) must be < 100 ms. |
| NFR-FW2 | The helper must compile without warnings on non-Windows platforms (guarded by `[SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]` and `OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` at the call site). |
| NFR-FW3 | No persistent CLI-side state is written to disk; the firewall rule itself is the persistence mechanism. |

## 4. Verification

### Automated tests

- `ParseHasPrivateRule` unit tests (pure function, no process spawning):
  - Rule exists with `Profiles: Private` → returns `true`
  - Rule exists with `Profiles: Private,Public` → returns `true`
  - Rule exists with `Profiles: Any` → returns `true`
  - Rule exists with `Profiles: Public` only → returns `false`
  - Rule present for a different program → returns `false`
  - Empty output → returns `false`

### Manual QA

> **Prerequisite:** remove any pre-existing Uno DevServer firewall rule:
> ```powershell
> Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "Uno DevServer*" } | Remove-NetFirewallRule
> ```

| # | Scenario | Steps | Acceptance criteria |
|---|----------|-------|---------------------|
| K1 | First run — rule absent | Run `uno-devserver start --httpPort 12345 --solution <path>` | UAC prompt appears; after accepting, `Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Uno DevServer (.NET Host)"` returns the rule with Profile = Private. |
| K2 | Subsequent run — rule present | Run `uno-devserver start` again | No UAC prompt; startup proceeds normally at normal speed. |
| K3 | Physical Android device | Deploy app to a physical device on the same Wi-Fi network | Hot Reload connection is established (DevServer indicator shows Connected). |
| K4 | UAC declined | Remove the rule, run `uno-devserver start`, decline UAC | Warning is logged with the manual `New-NetFirewallRule` command; DevServer starts normally. |
| K5 | Desktop / WASM app | Run DevServer for a Skia or WASM project (no physical device) | DevServer starts; if rule already exists no prompt, if absent one-time UAC prompt (acceptable — future mobile use is possible on the same machine). |

## 5. Out of Scope

- macOS / Linux (no Windows Firewall; those platforms are unaffected)
- Modifying `EntryPoint.cs` (the backward-compat VS-only path that spawns `dotnet + dll` directly — intentionally left unchanged)
- Port-based firewall rules (program-based rules are more precise and match the existing SDK rule pattern)
- Automatic rule cleanup on NuGet package uninstall
- **Group Policy–managed environments:** when an organization's GPO blocks `netsh` or periodically reverts user-created firewall rules, the automatic fix will fail gracefully (warning logged, manual command shown). The correct resolution in this case is for the IT administrator to deploy the rule via GPO for `dotnet.exe` (inbound Allow, Private and Domain profiles). This is documented in the public troubleshooting guide.
