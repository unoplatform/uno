# Uno Platform

The Uno Platform is an Open-Source .NET platform for building single-codebase, cross-platform applications for mobile, web (using WebAssembly), desktop, and embedded apps quickly.

Important notes:
- The core framework is free and open-source under the Apache 2 license, since its release in 2018; optional enterprise support and advanced tooling (such as Hot Design) are offered under paid plans
- Skia (using a full-screen canvas) and Native (using native elements) renderers are available
- Uno Platform uses the WinUI (UI APIs) and WinRT (non-UI APIs) API definitions, but does not use WinAppSDK/WinUI. WinAppSDK is only used when running the `netX.0-windows` target, for the other targets, only Uno Platform code is used
- Uno Platform uses official .NET mobile bindings directly, but does not use MAUI
- Uno Platform offers a comprehensive C# and XAML Hot Reload support, under the free plan
- Uno Platform apps can run on iOS/iPadOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and Browsers supporting WebAssembly
