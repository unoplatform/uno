# Capture

> [!TIP]
> This article covers Uno-specific information for the `Windows.Media.Capture` namespace. For a full description of the feature and its instructions, see [Windows.Media.Capture Namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.capture).

The `Windows.Media.Capture` namespace provides classes for capturing photos, audio recordings, and videos.

## `CameraCaptureUI`

`CameraCaptureUI` is currently only supported on Android, iOS, and WinUI. On other platforms, `CaptureFileAsync` will return `null`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `CaptureFileAsync` should only be called from the UI thread. Calling them from a background thread will throw an `InvalidOperationException`.

### Platform-specific

#### Android

If you are planning to use the `CameraCaptureUI`, your app must declare `android.permission.CAMERA` and `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions, otherwise the functionality will not work as expected:

```csharp
[assembly: UsesPermission("android.permission.CAMERA")]
[assembly: UsesPermission("android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE")]
```

#### iOS

On iOS, CameraCaptureUI uses the native `UIImagePickerController` to capture media. To request the necessary permissions, ensure that the `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys are added to the `Info.plist` file.

> [!NOTE]
> The `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key is required only if you are capturing videos. If you are only capturing photos, you can omit this key.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We need access to the camera to take photos.</string>
    <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We need access to the microphone to record videos.</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> iOS simulators do not have access to a camera. To test the camera functionality, you need to run the app on a physical device. When using a simulator, your app will open the Photo Library instead of the camera, but the functionality will work as expected once the app is deployed to a physical device.

#### WinUI

On WinUI, `CameraCaptureUI` provides a unified interface for capturing photos and videos, fully leveraging the platform's APIs. WinUI support is coming with v1.7+.

### Example

```csharp
#if __ANDROID__ || __IOS__ || __WINDOWS__
using Windows.Media.Capture;
#endif

public async Task CapturePhotoAsync()
{
#if __ANDROID__ || __IOS__ || __WINDOWS__
    var captureUI = new CameraCaptureUI();
    captureUI.PhotoSettings.Format = CameraCaptureUIPhotoFormat.Jpeg;
    
    var file = await captureUI.CaptureFileAsync(CameraCaptureUIMode.Photo);

    if (file != null)
    {
        // Handle the captured file (e.g., save or display it)
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle the cancellation or error
    }
#endif
}
```
