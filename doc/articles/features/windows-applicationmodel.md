# Package Information

> [!TIP]
> This article covers Uno-specific information for ApplicationModel. For a full description of the feature and instructions on using it, see [Windows.ApplicationModel Namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel).

* The `Windows.ApplicationModel.PackageId` class allows retrieving information about the application package.

## `PackageId`

### Android

* Due to the fact that version strings can be arbitrary on Android, we first try to parse `PackageInfo.VersionName`, if it fails, we try to use `PackageInfo.LongVersionCode`, and if that fails (this is a `long` value while WinUI uses `ushort`), we fall back to default to avoid exceptions (1.0.0.0).
* `FamilyName` and `Name` properties have the same value as the `Publisher` and cannot be retrieved programmatically.
* `FullName` property ends with the value of `LongVersionCode`, similar to WinUI, where it contains the app version.

### iOS

* Version strings may potentially be arbitrary on iOS as well (such version string would fail validation only during App Store upload), so we first try to parse the user-facing `CFBundleShortVersionString`, if it fails, we try to use `CFBundleVersion` and if that fails, we fall back to default to avoid exceptions (1.0.0.0).
* `FamilyName` and `Name` properties have the same value as the `Publisher` cannot be retrieved programmatically.
* `FullName` property ends with the value of `CFBundleVersion`, similarly to WinUI, where it contains the app version.
