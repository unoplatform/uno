# Using Uno.WinRT

Uno.WinRT is the non-UI layer of Uno Platform.

It is composed of APIs that have been present since the beginning of Uno Platform to provide cross-platform access to non-UI features such as generic filesystem, sensors, file/image/video picking, networking, and devices like MIDI, flashlight, geolocation, Game Pads and dozens more.

These APIs can be used in a nuget package directly, without depending on UI features.

For list of available APIs, browse the tree on the side of this document.
