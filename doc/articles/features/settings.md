* On each target platform, the native user preferences APIs are used for storage.
* `RoamingSettings` are not roamed across devices, as this feature has been disabled by WinUI.

ApplicationDataContainer localSettings = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings;
localSettings.Values["MySettingName"] = "A user setting";
```
