# Speech Recognition in Uno

> [!TIP]
> This article covers Uno-specific information for `Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition`. For a full description of the feature and instructions on using it, see [SpeechRecognition Namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.speechrecognition).

* The `Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition` class allows an application to recognize voice input.

Uno's implementation currently supports basic native speech recognition.

## Supported Features

The following features of `Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechRecognizer` are currently supported:

## Requirement

### iOS

* iOS 10 or later is required.
* The following lines need to be added to your info.plist:

  ```xml
  <key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>  
  <string>[SpeechRecognition usage description]</string>  
  <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>  
  <string>[SpeechRecognition usage description]</string> 
  ```

### Android

The following lines need to be added to your AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

## Limitation

In `Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechRecognitionResult`, only `Text`, `Alternates`, and `GetAlternates(uint maxAlternates)` are implemented.
In particular, `RawConfidence` and `Confidence` fields are not currently supported.
