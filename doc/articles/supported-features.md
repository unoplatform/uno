# Uno Platform Features

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking for `UnoFeature` reference, check the [Using the Uno.Sdk article](xref:Uno.Features.Uno.Sdk) instead.

## Development Flow

- Uno Platform's WinUI/UWP XAML
  - **Windows-first development**
  - **Faster compilation** for most of the development cycle, including UI code. iOS, Android, WebAssembly, macOS and Linux can be tested for platform-specific features.
  - Ability to develop responsive layout in Windowed mode using Windows 10.
  - Allows for **edit and continue** support from VS2017+
  - Allows for **UI and Non-UI code edit and continue** support
- Conditional platform features access
  - All XAML controls have **access to native properties** through conditional XAML
  - Ability to **add native controls in XAML**
- Full WinUI/UWP availability at compile time
  - Allows for the **compilation of open-source libraries** that depend only on WinUI/UWP and multi-targeted nuget packages
    - **XamlBehaviors library** support
- macOS Compilation
