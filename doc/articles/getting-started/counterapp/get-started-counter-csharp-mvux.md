# Counter App using C# Markup and MVUX

[Download the complete C# Markup + MVUX sample](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples/tree/master/reference/Counter/CSharp-MVUX)

[!INCLUDE [Intro](includes/include-intro.md)]

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Create a new Project with Uno Platform using Visual Studio Template Wizard or the **dotnet new** command
- Add elements to the C# file, using [C# Markup](xref:Uno.Extensions.Markup.Overview), to define the layout of the application
- Add code to the C# file to implement the application logic using the [Model-View-Update-eXtended (MVUX)](xref:Uno.Extensions.Mvux.Overview) pattern
- Use data binding to connect the UI to the application logic

To complete this tutorial, you don't need any prior knowledge of the Uno Platform or C#.

[!INCLUDE [VS](includes/include-create.md)]

## [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have the **Uno Platform Extension for Visual Studio** installed, follow [these instructions](xref:Uno.GetStarted.vs2022).

- Launch **Visual Studio** and click on **Create new project** on the Start Window. Alternatively, if you're already in Visual Studio, click **New, Project** from the **File** menu.

- Type `Uno Platform` in the search box

- Click **Uno Platform App**, then **Next**

- Name the project `Counter` and click **Create**

At this point you'll enter the **Uno Platform Template Wizard**, giving you options to customize the generated application. For this tutorial, we're only going to configure the markup language and the presentation framework.

- Select **Blank** in **Presets** selection

- Select the **Presentation** tab and choose **MVUX**

- Select the **Markup** tab and choose **C# Markup**

Before completing the wizard, take a look through each of the sections and see what other options are available. You can always come back and create a new project with different options later. For more information on all the template options, see [Using the Uno Platform Template](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.UsingWizard).

- Click **Create** to complete the wizard

The template will create a solution with a single cross-platform project, named `Counter`, ready to run.

### [Rider](#tab/rider)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have the **Uno Platform Extension for Visual Studio** installed, follow [these instructions](xref:Uno.GetStarted.Rider).

- Launch **Rider** and click on **New Solution** on the Start Window

- From the left menu, under the **Uno Platform** section, select **Uno Platform App**
  At this point, you'll see options for creating a new Uno app, allowing you to customize the generated application. For this tutorial, we will only configure the presentation framework.

- Name the project `Counter`

- Select **Blank** in **Presets** selection

- Select the **Presentation** tab and choose **MVUX**

- Select the Markup tab and choose **C# Markup**

- Click **Create** to complete the creation
  The template will create a solution with a single cross-platform project, named `Counter`, ready to run.

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have the **Uno Platform Extension for VS Code** installed, follow [these instructions](xref:Uno.GetStarted.vscode).

- Launch The Live Wizard by clicking [here](https://new.platform.uno/)

- Name the project `Counter` and click **Start**

- Select **Blank** in **Presets** selection

- Select the **Presentation** tab and choose **MVUX**

- Select the Markup tab and choose **C# Markup**

- Click **Create** to complete the wizard

- Copy the `dotnet new` command and run it from a terminal where you want your solution to be located.

- This will create a new folder called **Counter** containing the new application.

- Next, open the project using Visual Studio Code. In the terminal type the following:

  ```bash
  code ./Counter
  ```

- Visual Studio Code might ask to restore the NuGet packages. Allow it to restore them if asked.

- Once the solution has been loaded, in the status bar at the bottom left of VS Code, `Counter.sln` is selected by default. Select `Counter.csproj` to load the project instead.

## [Command Line](#tab/cli)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have the Uno Platform dotnet new templates installed, follow [dotnet new templates for Uno Platform](xref:Uno.GetStarted.dotnet-new).

From the command line, run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new unoapp -preset blank -presentation mvux -markup csharp -o Counter
```

This will create a new folder called **Counter** containing the new application.

If you want to discover all the options available in the **unoapp** template, run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new unoapp -h
```

Also, for more information on all the template options, see [Using the Uno Platform Template](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.UsingWizard).

## Data Binding

As the application uses MVUX, the `MainModel` class is used to generate a bindable ViewModel, `MainViewModel`. We can update the **`MainPage`** to use data binding to connect the UI to the application logic.

- Let's add the **`DataContext`** to our page. To do so, add `.DataContext(new MainViewModel(), (page, vm) => page` before `.Background(...)`. Remember to close the **`DataContext`** expression with a `)` at the end of the code. It should look similar to the code below:

    ```csharp
    this.DataContext(new MainViewModel(), (page, vm) => page
        .Background(ThemeResource.Get<Brush>("ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush"))
        .Content(
            ...
        )
    );
    ```

- Update the **`TextBlock`** by removing its current text content and replacing it with a binding expression for the **`Countable.Count`** property of the **`MainViewModel`**. Modify the existing **`Text`** property with `() => vm.Countable.Count, txt => $"Counter: {txt}"`. The adjusted code is as follows:

    ```csharp
    new TextBlock()
        .Margin(12)
        .HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center)
        .TextAlignment(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.TextAlignment.Center)
        .Text(() => vm.Countable.Count, txt => $"Counter: {txt}")
    ```

- Update the **`TextBox`** by binding the **`Text`** property to the **`Countable.Step`** property of the **MainViewModel**. The **`Mode`** of the binding is set to **`TwoWay`** so that the **`Countable.Step`** property is updated when the user changes the value in the **`TextBox`**.

    ```csharp
    new TextBox()
        .Margin(12)
        .HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center)
        .TextAlignment(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.TextAlignment.Center)
        .PlaceholderText("Step Size")
        .Text(x => x.Binding(() => vm.Countable.Step).TwoWay())
    ```

- Update the **`Button`** to add a **`Command`** property that is bound to the **`IncrementCounter`** task of the **`MainViewModel`**.

    ```csharp
    new Button()
        .Margin(12)
        .HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center)
        .Command(() => vm.IncrementCounter)
        .Content("Increment Counter by Step Size")
    ```

- The final code for **MainPage.cs** should look like this:

    ```csharp
    public sealed partial class MainPage : Page
    {
        public MainPage()
        {
            this.DataContext(new MainViewModel(), (page, vm) => page
                .Background(ThemeResource.Get<Brush>("ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush"))
                .Content(
                    new StackPanel()
                        .VerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center)
                        .Children(
                            new Image()
                                .Margin(12)
                                .HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center)
                                .Width(150)
                                .Height(150)
                                .Source("ms-appx:///Assets/logo.png"),
                            new TextBox()
                                .Margin(12)
                                .HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center)
                                .TextAlignment(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.TextAlignment.Center)
                                .PlaceholderText("Step Size")
                                .Text(x => x.Binding(() => vm.Countable.Step).TwoWay()),
                            new TextBlock()
                                .Margin(12)
                                .HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center)
                                .TextAlignment(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.TextAlignment.Center)
                                .Text(() => vm.Countable.Count, txt => $"Counter: {txt}"),
                            new Button()
                                .Margin(12)
                                .HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center)
                                .Command(() => vm.IncrementCounter)
                                .Content("Increment Counter by Step Size")
                        )
                )
            );
        }
    }
    ```
