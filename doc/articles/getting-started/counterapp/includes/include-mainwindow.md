Before proceeding, you should select a target platform and run the application. For more information on debugging an application, see for [Visual Studio](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.CreateAnApp.VS2022), [Visual Studio Code](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.CreateAnApp.VSCode), or [Rider](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.CreateAnApp.Rider).

## MainWindow and MainPage

The majority of a Uno Platform application is defined in a project, in this case, named **Counter**. This project contains files that define the layout of the application and files that implement the application logic.

The startup logic for the application is contained in the `App.xaml.cs` file. In the `OnLaunched` method, the `MainWindow` of the application is initialized with a `Frame`, used for navigation between pages, and the `MainPage` is set as the initial page.
