# Creating an app with VS Code

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to setup your environment first by [following our instructions](xref:Uno.GetStarted.vscode).

## Create the App

Creating an Uno Platform project is done [using dotnet new](xref:Uno.GetStarted.dotnet-new) and the Uno Platform Live Wizard by following these steps:

1. Open a browser and navigate to the online <a target="_blank" href="https://aka.platform.uno/app-wizard">Live Wizard</a>
1. Configure your new project by providing a project name, then click **Start**

    ![A screen showing how to choose a solution name](Assets/quick-start/live-wizard-01-choose-name.png)

1. Choose a template to build your application

    ![A screen showing how to choose template for the new app](Assets/quick-start/live-wizard-02-select-preset.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > For a detailed overview of the Uno Platform project wizard and all its options, see the [Wizard guide](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.UsingWizard).

1. Click the **Create** button on the top right corner, then click the **Copy** button

    ![A screen showing the dotnet new command to create the new app](Assets/quick-start/live-wizard-03-create-app.png)

1. In your terminal, navigate to the folder that will contain your new app.
1. Create a new project by pasting and executing the command that was previously generated in the Live Wizard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Apple targets are automatically disabled under Linux.

Next, open the project using Visual Studio Code.

* Let's assume your project is named `MyApp` and is located inside a `Projects` folder:

  * **Using the Terminal**
    Ensure you are at the **parent folder** (`Projects`) level, then run:

    ```bash
    code ./MyApp
    ```

  * **Using Visual Studio Code**
    1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
    2. Go to **File > Open Folder**.
    3. Navigate to the `Projects` folder and select the `MyApp` folder.
* Visual Studio Code might ask to restore the NuGet packages. Allow it to restore them if asked.
* Once the solution has been loaded, in the status bar at the bottom left of VS Code, `MyApp.sln` is selected by default. Select `MyApp.csproj` to load the project instead.

* > [!IMPORTANT]
  > A notification should appear prompting you to sign in or register with Uno Platform.
  >
  > Signing in with your Uno Platform account in Visual Studio Code unlocks powerful tools like Hot Reload, helping you speed up development.
  >
  > With a single registration, you also gain early access to new features and the opportunity to connect with the Uno Platform community, where you can share feedback and network.
  >
  > Detailed information on registration and sign-in is available <a href="https://aka.platform.uno/account-access" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Debug the App

Uno Platform provides integrated support for debugging your app on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### [**WebAssembly**](#tab/Wasm)

> [!NOTE]
> VS Code's built-in JavaScript debugger currently **[only supports](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/blob/main/OPTIONS.md)**:
>
> * **Google Chrome**
> * **Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)**
>
> To debug WebAssembly with VS Code, **one of these browsers must be installed**.
>
> Safari, Firefox, and other browsers are **not directly supported** via VS Code at the moment.

In VS Code :

1. In the [activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) select the debugger
1. Set the debugger launch to `Uno Platform WebAssembly Debug (Chrome)` or `Uno Platform WebAssembly Debug (Edge)`

![VS Code UI](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-chrome-debug.png)

In the status bar :

1. Just after the Uno logo, ensure the `MyApp` project is selected - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected
1. Next, click on the target framework to select `net9.0-browserwasm | Debug`

![status bar](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-browserwasm-project.png)

Finally, press `F5` to start the debugging session.

### [**Desktop**](#tab/skia)

In VS Code :

1. In the [activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) select the debugger
1. Set the debugger launch to `Uno Platform Mobile` or `Uno Platform Desktop (Debug)`

![VS Code UI](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-mobile-debug.png)

In the status bar :

1. Just after the Uno logo, ensure the `MyApp` project is selected - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected
1. Next click on the target framework to select `net9.0-desktop | Debug`

![status bar](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-desktop-project.png)

Finally, press `F5` to start the debugging session.

#### Debugging using WSL 2 on Windows

VS Code supports debugging Uno Platform Desktop apps through the WSL Extension:

1. Install the [WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
1. In the control palette, select **WSL: Connect to WSL**
1. Once connected to WSL, ensure that the [Uno Platform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unoplatform.vscode) is installed
1. Once the extension is installed, follow the same steps as the section above

#### Debugging on Linux Remotely

When connecting to a remote Linux machine using the [SSH Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh), in order for the user interface to show, it is required to specify the `DISPLAY` environment variable:

1. In the `.vscode/launch.json`, find the `Uno Platform Desktop (Debug)` section
1. In the `env` section, add the following:

    ```json
    "env": {
        "DISPLAY": ":0"
    },
    ```

This will allow the application to build on the remote machine and then show on the main display.

#### Considerations for Hot Reload

Note that C# Hot Reload is not available when running with the debugger. See [this section](xref:Uno.Platform.Studio.HotReload.Overview) for more information on Hot Reload.

### [**Android**](#tab/androiddebug)

In VS Code :

1. In the [activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) select the debugger
1. Set the debugger launch to `Uno Platform Mobile`

![VS Code UI](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-mobile-debug.png)

In the status bar :

1. Just after the Uno logo ensure the `MyApp` project is selected - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected
1. Next click on the target framework to select `net9.0-android | Debug`
1. Then select the device to debug with. You will need to connect an Android device or [create an Android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).

![status bar](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-android-project.png)

Finally, press `F5` to start the debugging session.

### [**iOS**](#tab/iosdebug)

> [!NOTE]
> Debugging for iOS is only possible when running locally (or remotely through [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)) on a macOS machine.

In VS Code :

1. In the [activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) select the debugger
1. Set the debugger launch to `Uno Platform Mobile`

![VS Code UI](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-mobile-debug.png)

In the status bar :

1. Just after the Uno logo ensure the `MyApp` project is selected - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected
1. Next click on the target framework to select `net9.0-ios | Debug`
1. Then select the device to debug with. You will need to connect an iOS device or [use an installed iOS simulator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/installing-additional-simulator-runtimes).

![status bar](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-ios-project.png)

Finally, press `F5` to start the debugging session.

> [!TIP]
> When deploying to an iOS device, you may encounter the following error: `errSecInternalComponent`. In such case, you'll need to unlock your keychain from a terminal inside VS Code by running the following command: `security unlock-keychain`

### [**Mac Catalyst**](#tab/catalystdebug)

> [!NOTE]
> Debugging for Mac Catalyst is only possible when running locally (or remotely through [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)) on a macOS machine.

In VS Code :

1. In the [activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) select the debugger

![VS Code UI](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-mobile-debug.png)

In the status bar :

1. Just after the Uno logo ensure the `MyApp` project is selected - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected
1. Next click on the target framework to select `net9.0-maccatalyst | Debug`
1. The `This Mac` device will be pre-selected. On Apple Silicon (arm64) Macs you will have the option to use `This Mac using Rosetta` to debug `x64` applications

![status bar](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-maccatalyst-project.png)

Finally, press `F5` to start the debugging session.

### [**Windows**](#tab/windowsdebug)
