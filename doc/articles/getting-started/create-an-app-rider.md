# Create an app with Rider

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to setup your environment first by [following our instructions](xref:Uno.GetStarted.Rider).

## Create the App

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Rider (2024.2 and above)**: For Rider (2024.2 and above), we have released versions of the Uno Platform Plugin that support creating Uno Platform projects using the "New Solution" dialog.
>   Make sure to follow the directions for **Rider 2024.2** provided below.
>
> - **Rider (2024.1 and earlier)**: Current versions of Rider (2024.1 and earlier) do not support creating Uno Platform projects using the "New Solution" dialog, even if the Uno Platform project template appears.
>   Make sure to follow the directions for **Rider 2024.1** provided below.

### [**Rider Version 2024.2+**](#tab/rider2024-2)

Creating an Uno Platform project is done by following these steps:

1. On the **Welcome to JetBrains Rider** screen, click **New Solution**.

    ![A screen showing the Welcome to JetBrains Rider screen](Assets/quick-start/rider-welcome-screen-new-solution.png)

1. From the project types list on the left, locate and click **Uno Platform App**. It will be under the **Uno Platform** section.
1. Configure your new project by providing a solution name and a directory location.
1. Choose a template to build your application.

    > [!TIP]
    > For a detailed overview of the Uno Platform project wizard and all its options, see the [Wizard guide](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.UsingWizard).

1. Click the create button and wait for the solution to load.

1. You should now have a folder structure that looks like this:

    ![A screen showing the structure of the solution in Rider](Assets/quick-start/rider-folder-structure.png)

### [**Previous Rider Version 2024.1**](#tab/rider2024-1)

Creating an Uno Platform project is done [using dotnet new](xref:Uno.GetStarted.dotnet-new) and the Uno Platform Live Wizard by following these steps:

1. Open a browser and navigate to the <a target="_blank" href="https://aka.platform.uno/app-wizard">Live Wizard</a>.
1. Configure your new project by providing a project name, then click **Start**.

    ![A screen showing how to choose a solution name](Assets/quick-start/live-wizard-01-choose-name.png)

1. Choose a template to build your application.

    ![A screen showing how to choose template for the new app](Assets/quick-start/live-wizard-02-select-preset.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > For a detailed overview of the Uno Platform project wizard and all its options, see the [Wizard guide](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.UsingWizard).

1. Click the **Create** button on the top right corner, then click the **Copy** button.

    ![A screen showing the dotnet new command to create the new app](Assets/quick-start/live-wizard-03-create-app.png)

1. In your terminal, navigate to the folder that will contain your new app.

1. Create a new project by pasting the command that was previously generated in the Live Wizard.

1. Open the solution in Rider, you should now have a folder structure that looks like this:

    ![A screen showing the structure of the solution in Rider](Assets/quick-start/rider-folder-structure.png)

> [!TIP]
> If you are not able to run the online Live Wizard, you can explore the [`dotnet new` template](xref:Uno.GetStarted.dotnet-new) directly in the CLI.

### Considerations for macOS and Linux

When using macOS or Linux for developing your application and you have selected the WinAppSDK target, you may get the **UNOB0014** error which mentions building on macOS or Linux is not supported. While Uno Platform is able to filter out unsupported targets from the command line and other IDE, Rider currently [does not support this automatic filtering](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-114790/Unsupported-target-framework-filtering).

To correct this, you'll need to modify your `csproj` file in order to make the project compatible.

You can change this line:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net9.0-android;net9.0-ios;net9.0-maccatalyst;net9.0-windows10.0.26100;net9.0-browserwasm;net9.0-desktop</TargetFrameworks>
```

To be:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net9.0-android;net9.0-browserwasm;net9.0-desktop</TargetFrameworks>
<TargetFrameworks Condition=" $([MSBuild]::IsOSPlatform('windows')) ">$(TargetFrameworks);net9.0-windows10.0.26100</TargetFrameworks>
<TargetFrameworks Condition=" !$([MSBuild]::IsOSPlatform('linux')) ">$(TargetFrameworks);net9.0-ios;net9.0-maccatalyst</TargetFrameworks>
```

Make sure to adjust the list of target frameworks based on the platforms you have in your original list.

## Debug the App

### [**Desktop**](#tab/desktop)

Select the **MyUnoApp (Desktop)** debug profile then click the green arrow or the debug button.

![A view of the Rider taskbar for Desktop](Assets/quick-start/run-desktop-rider.png)

### [**Android**](#tab/android)

Set the Android debug profile in the debugger toolbar, then click the green arrow or the debug button.
![A view of the Rider taskbar for Android](Assets/quick-start/run-android-rider.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you're using a physical device or the emulator, the app will install but will not automatically open. You will have to manually open it.

### [**WebAssembly**](#tab/wasm)

Select the **MyUnoApp (WebAssembly)** debug profile then click the green arrow or the debug button.

![A view of the Rider taskbar for WebAssembly](Assets/quick-start/run-wasm-rider.png)

A new browser window will automatically run your application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is currently a known issue with **Rider version 2024.2** on **macOS** that causes an **'Access to localhost was denied' error when launching applications on WebAssembly**. Until this issue is resolved, you will need to reload the browser page to successfully load the application.
> Please refer to this opened related [Rider issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-115776/MacOS-WASM-Access-to-localhost-was-denied-on-Initial-Run) to track progress on this issue we are prioritizing with the JetBrains team.
>
> [!NOTE]
> There is no debugging for WebAssembly within Rider for Uno Platform, but you can debug using the [built-in Chrome tools](external/uno.wasm.bootstrap/doc/debugger-support.md#how-to-use-the-browser-debugger).

### [**iOS**](#tab/ios)

Select the **MyUnoApp** debug profile with the mobile Apple logo then click the green arrow or the debug button.

![A view of the Rider taskbar for iOS](Assets/quick-start/run-ios-rider.png)
