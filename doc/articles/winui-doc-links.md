# Links to WinUI documentation

Uno Platform's API is derived from the WinUI application framework. Microsoft provides [extensive documentation for WinUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/). Rather than duplicate all of it, here we list selected entries that are especially applicable to Uno Platform developers.

Note that some instructions may not apply when using Uno Platform. For example, some articles will instruct you to create a new WinUI application in Visual Studio - you would, in that case, create a new Uno Platform application](get-started.md) instead.
