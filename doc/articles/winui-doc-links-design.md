# WinUI documentation - Design

Uno Platform's API is derived from the WinUI application framework. Microsoft provides [extensive documentation for WinUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/). Rather than duplicate all of it, here we list selected entries that are especially applicable to Uno Platform developers.

These resources can serve as a starting point when designing your Uno Platform application.

> [!TIP]
> Use **[Hot Design<sup>®</sup>](xref:Uno.HotDesign.Overview)** to visually design your application while it runs, and leverage **[Hot Design<sup>®</sup> Agent](xref:Uno.HotDesign.Agent)** for AI-assisted UI creation and refinement based on these design principles.

Some of the points of guidance may be specific to Windows 10's [Fluent design language](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/). When designing your cross-platform application, feel free to choose the principles that best apply to your users and the app experience you're aiming for.
