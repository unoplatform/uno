## What is Hot Design?

**Hot Design** transforms your live, running app into a real-time visual designer that works with any IDE on any OS. It allows you to make UI changes on the fly without restarting your app or losing state, while seamlessly synchronizing your XAML code and visual designs.

In addition, [Hot Reload](xref:Uno.Studio.HotReload.Overview) works seamlessly with **Hot Design**, allowing you to see UI changes instantly without rebuilding your app. This boosts productivity, reduces iteration time, and provides real-time feedback for both visual and functional tweaks in your UI. Hot Reload also includes a visual indicator to help you monitor changes as you develop, further enhancing your workflow.

**Hot Design** is part of the **Uno Platform Studio**, a suite of tools designed to streamline your cross-platform app development and boost productivity.
