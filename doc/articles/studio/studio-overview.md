## What's the difference between Uno.Sdk and Uno Platform Studio?

**Uno.Sdk** is the core SDK that powers the Uno Platform, enabling you to build cross-platform applications using C# and XAML from a single project. **Uno Platform Studio** is a suite of productivity tools that enhance your development experience, including Hot Design<sup>®</sup>, Hot Reload, and Design-to-Code.

As the **Uno Platform Studio** is built on top of **Uno.Sdk**, it's only available to applications that have been created, or updated, to use the **Uno.Sdk**. If you haven't updated your project to use the **Uno.Sdk**, you can do so by following the [migration guide](xref:Uno.Development.MigratingFromPreviousReleases).
