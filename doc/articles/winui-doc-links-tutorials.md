# WinUI documentation - Tutorials

Uno Platform's API is derived from the WinUI application framework. Microsoft provides [extensive documentation for WinUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/). Rather than duplicate all of it, here we list selected entries that are especially applicable to Uno Platform developers.

You can work through these tutorials either as single-platform UWP applications or as multi-platform Uno Platform applications. In the latter case, when the tutorial instructs you to create a new UWP application in Visual Studio, you should create a [new Uno Platform application](get-started.md) instead.
