# WinUI documentation - Tutorials

Uno Platform's API is derived from the WinUI application framework. Microsoft provides [extensive documentation for WinUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop). Rather than duplicate all of it, here we list selected entries that are especially applicable to Uno Platform developers.

You can work through these tutorials either as single-platform WinUI applications or as multi-platform Uno Platform applications. In the latter case, when the tutorial instructs you to create a new WinUI application in Visual Studio, you should create a [new Uno Platform application](get-started.md) instead.

  Find out about the Uno specifics to remark on this in the [Uno Specifics for WebView2](xref:Uno.Controls.WebView2) and the [implemented Views for the supported or not supported properties and events in your Uno Apps](./implemented/microsoft-ui-xaml-controls-webview2.md)
