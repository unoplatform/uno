# Issues related to all development environments

### Runtime error `No parameterless constructor defined for XXXX`

This error is generally caused by some missing [IL Linker](https://github.com/mono/linker/tree/master/docs) configuration on WebAssembly. You may need to add some of your application assemblies in the LinkerConfig.xml file of your project. You can find [additional information in the documentation](features/using-il-linker-webassembly.md).

Similar error messages using various libraries:

- `Don't know how to detect when XXX is activated/deactivated, you may need to implement IActivationForViewFetcher` (ReactiveUI)

#### Cannot build with both Uno.WinUI and Uno.UI NuGet packages referenced

This issue generally happens when referencing an Uno.UI (using UWP APIs) NuGet package in an application that uses Uno.WinUI (Using WinAppSDK APIs).

For instance, if your application has `<PackageReference Include="Uno.WinUI"` in the `csproj` files, this means that you'll need to reference WinUI versions of NuGet packages.

For instance:

- `Uno.UI` -> `Uno.WinUI`

### Abnormally long build times when using Roslyn analyzers

It is a good practice to use Roslyn analyzers to validate your code during compilation, but some generators may have difficulty handling the source generated by the Uno Platform (one notable example is [GCop](https://github.com/Geeksltd/GCop)). You may need to disable those for Uno projects or get an update from the analyzer's vendor.
