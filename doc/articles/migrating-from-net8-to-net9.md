- Install/Update the IDE of your choice:  
  - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) - minimal version **17.12** or later  
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - minimal version **1.94** or later with the related [**C# Dev Kit**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) stable version
  - [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) - minimal version **2024.3** or later
- Run [uno.check](xref:UnoCheck.UsingUnoCheck) to install .NET 9.
- Change all your target framework (TFM) references from `net8.0` to `net9.0`, and `net8.0-*` to `net9.0-*`.
