# Contributing docs to Uno Platform

Good documentation is essential, and writing docs is a valued contribution that makes Uno more useful for everybody. This article covers *when* to write docs and *what* you should write, with a focus on two of the most common forms of documentation: step-by-step guides (ie howtos or tutorials), and feature documentation.

We have a few different fill-in-the-blanks style templates, linked below.

For the DocFX tool used to build the docs website, see [more info here](docfx.md).

## Key links

* how-to template: https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/.howto-template.md
* WinUI feature template: https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/.feature-template.md
* Uno-only feature template: https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/.feature-template-uno-only.md

## Resources

Some useful resources on writing good technical documentation:

* [ReactiveUI docs style guide](https://www.reactiveui.net/contribute/content-style-guide/)
* [Divio's Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/)

## Writing step-by-step guides

Step-by-step guides that address a particular problem or use case that multiple developers are likely to encounter.

* For longer tutorials, it's fine to split the content over multiple pages.
* Guides should always be accompanied by working code. Standalone applications should be added to the [Uno.Samples repository](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples) and linked to from the associated tutorial.
* Use the [how-to template](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/.howto-template.md) as a starting point.
* Structure guides as a series of clear, actionable steps. After carrying out every step as described, the user should end up with working code that demonstrates the objective of the guide (either a standalone sample, or a new feature in their existing app).

## Documenting features

Let's say you're implementing a new Uno Platform feature. Do you need to add documentation for it?

It depends.

There's two different cases:

### I'm implementing a feature from the WinUI contract

Uno's API matches WinUI's API, and most of the time, a new Uno feature will map to an existing WinUI feature.

In this case, to the extent that the behavior you're adding is the same as the WinUI behavior, you **don't** need to add documentation. The existing WinUI documentation is fine. It's already linked to from [Uno's reference documentation](../implemented-views.md).

What if the Uno behavior deviates from WinUI behavior?

If it's just a case of part of the functionality not being implemented yet, **and** the developer using the corresponding type/method/event would discover that it's marked with the `[NotImplemented]` attribute, then that's fine - there's no need to document it further.

But sometimes the functionality **can't** be supported, due to intrinsic limitations of the target platform. (This is more likely to be the case with non-UI features.) And/or part of the functionality may implicitly fail to work, even though none of the entry points are marked `NotImplemented`.

In those cases, it's important to add documentation. Copy the [WinUI feature template](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/.feature-template.md) to the [features directory](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/tree/master/doc/articles/features) (or [controls directory](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/tree/master/doc/articles/controls) for controls inheriting from `FrameworkElement`) and fill in the appropriate sections. Make sure to fill in the matrix describing which features are supported on which platforms.

### I'm implementing a feature that's not part of WinUI

Rarely, features are added to Uno Platform that aren't part of WinUI (`VisibleBoundsPadding` and `ElevatedView` are two examples). Somewhat more commonly, platform-specific functionality or options are added to an existing feature.

It's important to document these novel features when you add them, since they aren't covered anywhere else. Again, copy the [Uno-only feature template here](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/.feature-template-uno-only.md) to the [features directory](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/tree/master/doc/articles/features) and fill in the sections.

## Updating the documentation from linked repositories

The Uno Platform documentation is aggregated onto https://platform.uno/docs/articles/intro.html, including some repositories that are in the unoplatform GitHub organization.

### Updating the documentation for other repositories

The CI includes a step to clones repositories at a specified commit or branch, and provides the path to the DocFX table of content.

To include documentation (let's take Uno.Themes as an example):

* Update your documentation in `Uno.Themes` repository, preferably in a folder named `doc`
* Include a file named `toc.yml`, using this file as a template:

  ```yml
  items:
  - name: Introduction to Uno Themes
    href: ../Readme.md
  ```

* Once you have merged your changes into `Uno.Themes`' `main` (or the default branch), take the commit id and place it in the `doc/import_external_docs.ps1` of the uno repository, as follows:

   ```powershell
   @("https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.themes", "uno.themes", "INSERT_COMMIT_HASH_OR_BRANCH_NAME"),
   ```

* Create a PR and validate that the content you added is appearing in the Uno Platform `toc.yml` where `external/uno.themes/` is visible. Ensure href path ends by `toc.yml` for all nodes to be visible.
