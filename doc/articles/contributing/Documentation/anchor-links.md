# Anchor Links in Documentation

Anchor links (also called **fragment links**) allow you to link directly to a specific section within a doc file. They are useful for cross-referencing headings and improving navigation in long documentation pages.

## How Anchor Links Work

Anchor links in docfx (and Markdig) are automatically generated from Markdown headings. For example:

```markdown
## My Section Title
```

Generates the anchor:

```md
#my-section-title
```

You can then link to this section using:

```markdown
[Jump to My Section](#my-section-title)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Anchors are generated by converting the heading to lowercase and replacing spaces and most special characters with hyphens.

## Best Practices

- Use anchor links to help readers jump between related sections.
- Always verify that the anchor exists to avoid broken links.
- Avoid using identical headings in the same file – they will result in duplicate anchors.

## Linking to Anchors in Other Files

You can link to a specific heading in another Markdown file like this:

```markdown
[Go to Subsection](otherfile.md#subsection-heading)
```

Make sure the linked file is part of the TOC or referenced properly so that DocFX includes it in the output.

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ `#My-Section-Title` → won't work (wrong casing)
- ❌ `#my section title` → won't work (missing `-` between the words)
- ❌ Linking to headings that are dynamically generated (e.g., via include files) may break if anchors are not preserved
