\[\*: Workaround]

## Controlling the Keyboard on iOS

If a view needs to keep the keyboard opened when tapping on it, use the `Uno.UI.Controls.Window.SetNeedsKeyboard` attached property.

## Paste event

Support for capturing and handling the `Paste` event is implemented on all targets except for macOS.

In the case of Android, it is currently limited to the pastes that are triggered by the native context menu (e.g. after long-pressing the `TextBox`). It cannot detect paste triggered by the virtual keyboard or via a hardware keyboard shortcut.

## Pointer capture on WebAssembly

In addition to focus, `TextBox` control also captures pointers, so that manipulations like scrolling through contents are possible. However, on WASM setting the programmatic capture will prevent the native scrolling behavior of the underlying `<input>`. For that reason, we avoid performing the pointer capture in this case. If you still want to capture the pointer, you can do so by setting the `IsPointerCaptureRequired` attached property to `true`:

In C#:

```csharp
#if __WASM__
myTextBox.IsPointerCaptureRequired = true;
#endif
```

Or in XAML:

```xml
<TextBox wasm:IsPointerCaptureRequired="True" />
```

> Follow [Platform-specific XAML guide](xref:Uno.Development.PlatformSpecificXaml) to add the `wasm` namespace.

The value only affects WebAssembly, all other targets capture by default.

## Customizing the Enter key appearance

On mobile targets you can customize the visual appearance of the Enter key on the virtual keyboard. This can be done using the `TextBox.ReturnKeyType` property on iOS, the `TextBox.ImeOptions` property on Android, and the `TextBox.EnterKeyHint` property on WebAssembly.

```csharp
#if __IOS__
MyTextBox.ReturnKeyType = UIReturnKeyType.Search;
#elif __ANDROID__
MyTextBox.ImeOptions = ImeAction.Search;
#elif __WASM__
MyTextBox.EnterKeyHint = EnterKeyHint.Search;
#endif
```
