# Developing with Uno Platform

Write applications once in XAML and/or C# and deploy them to [any target platform](getting-started/requirements.md).

## About Uno

* [What is Uno Platform?](xref:Uno.Documentation.Intro)
* [How does Uno Platform work?](xref:Uno.Development.HowItWorks)
* [Supported target platforms](xref:Uno.GettingStarted.Requirements)
* [Supported .NET versions by platform](xref:Uno.Development.NetVersionSupport)

## Mastering the basics

The WinUI application API which Uno Platform uses is extensively documented by Microsoft. We've [selected some articles from Microsoft](winui-doc-links.md) which will jump-start your Uno Platform development.

Here are some articles which cover the basics of cross-platform Uno development:

* [The structure of an Uno Platform codebase](uno-app-solution-structure.md)
* Platform-specific code: [C#](platform-specific-csharp.md) and [XAML](platform-specific-xaml.md)
* [Best practices for developing Uno Platform applications](best-practices-uno.md)

## WinUI features

These articles cover general WinUI features in Uno Platform, discussing what's supported and which platform-specific constraints exist.

* [Accessibility](features/working-with-accessibility.md)
* [Assets in shared code](features/working-with-assets.md)
* [Custom fonts](features/custom-fonts.md)
* [Shapes & Brushes](features/shapes-and-brushes.md)
* [Handling user input](features/pointers-keyboard-and-other-user-inputs.md)
* [Using Fluent styles in legacy apps](features/using-winui2.md)

## WinUI controls

Uno Platform provides support for a large number of WinUI controls, panels, and visual primitives - see [a complete list](implemented-views.md) in the Reference documentation. The 'WinUI controls' section in the Table of Contents on the left covers platform-specific constraints and extensions for selected controls.

## WinRT features (non-visual APIs)

Uno Platform supports a number of non-visual APIs from Windows Runtime namespaces on non-Windows platforms, like [clipboard management](features/windows-applicationmodel-datatransfer.md) and [sensor access](features/windows-devices-sensors.md).
