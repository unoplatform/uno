# How to [complete TaskX]

<!-- For available Markdown syntax, check out https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ -->

* This document template is for How-tos that take the reader step by step through completing a particular task that might be encountered while developing an Uno Platform app.
* How-tos should be sufficiently detailed that a reader following along will, at the end, have a working app that demonstrates the desired end result.
* Do link to the rest of the documentation, and to the WinUI documentation where appropriate.
* Do link to the final working code. Normally, you'll upload it to [Uno.Samples](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples).
* If your guide ends up being very long, consider splitting it into multiple pages.
* Do place your doc in the doc/articles/guides directory. If you have multiple pages, put them in their own subdirectory.
* Do include screenshots showing what the output looks like.
* Do **preserve the correct formatting** for parts of this template that are in DocFX-flavored Markdown - https://platform.uno/docs/articles/uno-development/docfx.html#docfx-flavored-markdown

* Add a short intro explaining who and what your guide is for.
