                    Please provide a **MINIMAL REPRO PROJECT** and the **STEPS TO REPRODUCE**

                    To create a minimal reproduction project: 📦 

                    - Create an Uno app through:
                    - `dotnet new install Uno.Templates` and `dotnet new unoapp`
                    - or through the [Visual Studio extension](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-vs-2022.html)
                    - Make sure to add the least code possible to demonstrate the issue
                    - Keep all project heads, even if the platforms are seemingly not relevant to your issue
                    - Remove all the `obj/bin` folders and zip the folder.
                    - Attach the zip file to the issue

                    If the issue is visible on WebAssembly and uses only XAML: 🌐

                    - Visit https://playground.platform.uno
                    - Add your code and data context as needed
                    - Create a link and paste it here
