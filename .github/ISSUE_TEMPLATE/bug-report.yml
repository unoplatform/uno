                    Please provide a **MINIMAL REPRO PROJECT** and the **STEPS TO REPRODUCE**

                    To create a minimal reproduction project:

                    - Create an Uno app through:
                    - `dotnet new install Uno.Templates` and `dotnet new unoapp`
                    - or through the [Visual Studio extension](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-vs-2022.html)
                    - Make sure to add the least code possible to demonstrate the issue
                    - Keep all project heads, even if the platforms are seemingly not relevant to your issue
                    - Remove all the `obj/bin` folders and zip the folder.
                    - Attach the zip file to the issue

                    If the issue is visible on WebAssembly and uses only XAML:

                    - Visit https://playground.platform.uno
                    - Add your code and data context as needed
                    - Create a link and paste it here

      description: |
                    To make sure this is an Uno Platform specific issue, try running your sample application on Windows using the UWP or WinUI project. If it does not work on Windows either, it may be a Windows issue or it may be a documentation issue.
                    In this case, [open a discussion](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/discussions) instead.
