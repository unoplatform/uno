// This log tracks the current version of each control ported over from WinUI.
// It is intended to be modified by hand after updating each WinUI control.
// This list may be used for automated change tracking in the future.
//
// Version is indicated by the full commit SHA that was last ported from c++ to c#.
// Versioning is usually done at the control directory level but may be done for individual
// files as well by adding the full path.
//
// Format is:
// <Directory> : <Commit SHA>
// <File Path> : <Commit SHA>
//
// Make sure to arrange alphabetically with more-specific locations at the end.
