      org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser:
      @short_description: File chooser portal

      The FileChooser portal allows sandboxed applications to ask
      the user for access to files outside the sandbox. The portal
      backend will present the user with a file chooser dialog.

      The selected files will be made accessible to the application
      (which may involve adding it to the :ref:`Documents
      portal<org.freedesktop.portal.Documents>`).

      This documentation describes version 4 of this interface.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser">
    <!--
      OpenFile:
      @parent_window: Identifier for the application window, see :doc:`window-identifiers`
      @title: Title for the file chooser dialog
      @options: Vardict with optional further information
      @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` object representing this call

      Asks to open one or more files.

      Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

      * ``handle_token`` (``s``)

        A string that will be used as the last element of the @handle. Must be a valid
        object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` documentation for
        more information about the @handle.

      * ``accept_label`` (``s``)

        Label for the accept button. Mnemonic underlines are allowed.

      * ``modal`` (``b``)

        Whether the dialog should be modal. Default is true.

      * ``multiple`` (``b``)

        Whether multiple files can be selected or not. Default is single-selection.

      * ``directory`` (``b``)

        Whether to select for folders instead of files. Default is to select files.

        This option was added in version 3.

      * ``filters`` (``a(sa(us))``)

        List of serialized file filters.

        Each item in the array specifies a single filter to offer to the user.

        The first string is a user-visible name for the filter. The ``a(us)``
        specifies a list of filter strings, which can be either a glob-style
        pattern (indicated by 0) or a MIME type (indicated by 1). Patterns are
        case-sensitive.

        To match different capitalizations of, e.g. ``'*.ico'``, use a pattern
        like: ``'*.[iI][cC][oO]'``.

        Example: ``[('Images', [(0, '*.ico'), (1, 'image/png')]), ('Text', [(0, '*.txt')])]``

        Note that filters are purely there to aid the user in making a useful
        selection. The portal may still allow the user to select files that
        don't match any filter criteria, and applications must be prepared to
        handle that.

      * ``current_filter`` (``(sa(us))``)

        Request that this filter be set by default at dialog creation. If
        the filters list is nonempty, it should match a filter in the
        list to set the default filter from the list. Alternatively, it
        may be specified when the list is empty to apply the filter
        unconditionally.

      * ``choices`` (``a(ssa(ss)s)``)

        List of serialized combo boxes to add to the file chooser.

        For each element, the first string is an ID that will be returned
        with the response, the second string is a user-visible label. The
        ``a(ss)`` is the list of choices, each being an ID and a
        user-visible label. The final string is the initial selection,
        or "", to let the portal decide which choice will be initially selected.
        None of the strings, except for the initial selection, should be empty.

        As a special case, passing an empty array for the list of choices
        indicates a boolean choice that is typically displayed as a check
        button, using "true" and "false" as the choices.

        Example: ``[('encoding', 'Encoding', [('utf8', 'Unicode (UTF-8)'), ('latin15', 'Western')], 'latin15'), ('reencode', 'Reencode', [], 'false')]``

      * ``current_folder`` (``ay``)

        Suggested folder from which the files should be opened.

        The byte array contains a path in the same encoding as the file
        system, and it's expected to be terminated by a nul byte.

        If the path points to a location in the document storage, it will be
        replaced with the path to the location on the host.

        The portal implementation is free to ignore this option.


      The following results get returned via the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response` signal:

      * ``uris`` (``as``)

        An array of strings containing the uris of the selected files. All URIs
        have the ``file://`` scheme.

      * ``choices`` (``a(ss)``)

        An array of pairs of strings, the first string being the ID of a
        combobox that was passed into this call, the second string being
        the selected option.

        Example: ``[('encoding', 'utf8'), ('reencode', 'true')]``

      * ``current_filter`` (``(sa(us))``)

        The filter that was selected. This may match a filter in the
        filter list or another filter that was applied unconditionally.
